# Summary

FieldTrip `@oostenveldFieldTripOpenSource2011` -> "Oostenveld et al. (2011)" is a `@MATLAB2020` -> "MATLAB" toolbox for the analysis of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephelography (MEG) data. Typically, a researcher will create an analysis pipeline by scripting a sequence of high level FieldTrip functions. Depending on researcher coding style, readability and reproducibility of the custom written analysis pipeline is variable. `reproducescript` is a new functionality in the toolbox that allows complete reproduction of MATLAB-based scripts with little extra efforts on behalf of the user. Starting from the researchers' idiosyncratic pipeline scripts, this new functionality allows researchers to automatically create and publish analysis pipeline scripts in a standardized format, along with all relevant intermediate data.


# Statement of Need
Unsound scientific practices have led to a replication crisis in psychological science in recent years `[@ opensciencecollaborationEstimatingReproducibilityPsychological2015; @ simmonsFalsePositivePsychologyUndisclosed2011]` -> "(Open Science Collaboration, 2015; Simmons et al., 2011)", and it is unlikely that cognitive neuroscience is an exception `[@buttonPowerFailureWhy2013; @gilmoreProgressOpennessTransparency2017; @szucsEmpiricalAssessmentPublished2017]` -> "(Button et al., 2013; Gilmore et al., 2017; Szucs et al., 2017)". One way to combat this crisis is through increasing methodological transparency `[@gilmoreProgressOpennessTransparency2017; @gleesonCommitmentOpenSource2017; @zwaanMakingReplicationMainstream2017]` -> (Gilmore et al., 2017; Gleeson et al., 2017; Zwaan et al., 2017), but the increased sophistication of experimental designs and analysis methods results in data analysis getting so complex that the methods sections of manuscripts in most journals is too short to represent the analysis in sufficient detail. Therefore, researchers are increasingly encouraged to share their data and analysis pipelines along with their published results `@gleesonCommitmentOpenSource2017` -> (Gleeson et al., 2017). However, analysis scripts are often written by researchers without formal training in computer science, resulting in the quality and readability of these analysis scripts to be highly dependent on individual coding expertise and style. Even though the computational outcomes and interpretation of the results can be correct, the inconsistent style and quality of analysis scripts make reviewing the details of the analysis difficult for other researchers that are either involved in the study or not, and the quality of the scripts might compromise the reproducibility of obtained results. The purpose of `reproducescript` is to automatically create analysis pipeline scripts in a standardized format, along with all relevant intermediate data, that are fully reproducible and can directly be shared with peers.
